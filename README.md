## Project Overview

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! In this Jupyter Notebook, we explore the fascinating world of predictive analysis on data from the Titanic. Our primary goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict which passengers survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

### About the Titanic

The Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic tragically sank after colliding with an iceberg. This catastrophic event claimed the lives of 1,502 out of the 2,224 passengers and crew on board. The sinking of the Titanic had a profound impact on global safety regulations for ships and remains an enduring story in history.

### Data Source

The dataset and information used in this project have been sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and datasets. The dataset contains various features related to passengers on the Titanic, including socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.
